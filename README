LOLPython is a modification on Python that changes to a lulzier syntax.
It's implimented through PLY

lolpython.lang is a syntax highlighter file for gedit, for use with 
LOLPython.

lolpython.py is a slightly modified version of lolpython from 
http://dalkescientific.com/writings/diary/archive/2007/06/01/lolpython.html

I've added some little things like OBTW..TLDR equivalent to """.."""

Added a shortcut to my ~/.bashrc to for 

alias lolpy="python /home/jamtot/LOLPython/lolpython.py"

so I can just type 

$ pylol code.lol 

to run
